# MIDIDance

Interface between a number of Arduino boards via USB and a MIDI-capable software like a synthesizer, [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/) etc.
Written in [Processing](http://processing.org/).

Detects sudden movements on any one axis and converts it to a specified MIDI tone. Any given set of axis can be assigned also to MIDI controllers, transmitting rescaled values without beat detection.

See comments in source code for details.
